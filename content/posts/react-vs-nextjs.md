# React vs Next.js: Making the Right Choice

When starting a new web project, one of the first decisions you'll face is choosing between React and Next.js. Let's explore the differences and help you make an informed decision.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the view layer and provides:

- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for efficient updates
- Large ecosystem and community
- Flexibility in architecture choices

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that adds:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- File-based routing
- API routes
- Built-in optimizations

## Key Differences

### 1. Routing
- **React**: Requires additional libraries (React Router)
- **Next.js**: Built-in file-based routing

### 2. Rendering
- **React**: Client-side rendering by default
- **Next.js**: SSR, SSG, and CSR options

### 3. Configuration
- **React**: Manual configuration needed
- **Next.js**: Zero-config with sensible defaults

### 4. Performance
- **React**: Depends on implementation
- **Next.js**: Optimized out of the box

## When to Use React

Choose React when:
- Building a single-page application (SPA)
- You need maximum flexibility
- Working on a large team with established patterns
- Building complex state management systems

## When to Use Next.js

Choose Next.js when:
- SEO is important
- You need fast initial page loads
- Building a content-heavy website
- Want built-in optimizations

## Conclusion

Both React and Next.js are excellent choices. React offers flexibility and control, while Next.js provides a complete solution with best practices built-in. Choose based on your project's specific needs.
