# Understanding Static Generation in Next.js

Static Generation is one of Next.js's most powerful features. Let's dive deep into what it is and why it matters.

## What is Static Generation?

Static Generation (SSG) pre-renders pages at build time. This means:
- HTML is generated once during build
- Pages are served as static files
- Blazing fast performance
- Perfect for content that doesn't change often

## Benefits of SSG

1. **Performance**: Pre-rendered pages load instantly
2. **SEO**: Search engines love static HTML
3. **Cost**: Cheaper to host static files
4. **Security**: No server-side code execution

## When to Use SSG

Perfect for:
- Blog posts
- Documentation
- Marketing pages
- E-commerce product pages

## Implementation

```jsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  return posts.map(post => ({
    slug: post.slug
  }))
}
```

Static Generation is the key to building fast, scalable web applications!
